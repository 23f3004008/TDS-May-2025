# HTML File Counter - User Guide

## What This Program Does
This program is like a detective that searches through web pages to count HTML files! It looks at a special website and counts how many HTML files have names starting with letters in the range you choose. For example, it can tell you how many files start with letters A through M!

## Requirements Before Running
Before you start, you'll need to install some special tools. Don't worry, it's easy!

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands:
   ```
   pip install requests
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Running the Program
1. Open your terminal/command prompt

### 2. Using the Program
The program will ask you two questions:

1. **Enter the start letter (A-Z):**
   - Type ONE letter where you want to start counting
   - Example: type `A` to start with files beginning with A
