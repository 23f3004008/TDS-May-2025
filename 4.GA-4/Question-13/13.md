# Table Number Sum Calculator - User Guide

## What This Program Does
This program is like a super-fast calculator that can add up all the numbers in tables from special webpages! You give it some "seed" numbers, and it will:
1. Visit special webpages created with those seeds
2. Find all the tables on each page
3. Add up ALL the numbers it finds
4. Give you the grand total!

## Requirements Before Running
Before you start, you'll need to install some special tools. Don't worry, it's easy!

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and run these commands:
   ```
   pip install playwright
   pip install asyncio
   ```
3. After installing playwright, run this extra command:
   ```
   playwright install
   ```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Running the Program
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Go to the folder containing `sumr.py`
3. Type: `python sumr.py` and press Enter

### 2. Using the Program
The program will ask you to enter seed numbers:

1. Type a seed number (any positive whole number) and press Enter
2. You can enter as many seed numbers as you want
3. When you're done entering numbers, type `s` and press Enter

For example:
```
Seed number or 's' to start: 12
Seed number or 's' to start: 13
Seed number or 's' to start: 14
Seed number or 's' to start: s
```

## Common Problems and Solutions

### If you get an error about invalid input:
1. Make sure you're only entering whole numbers
2. Don't use decimal points or letters (except 's')
3. Don't use negative numbers
4. Make sure to type 's' (lowercase) when you're done

### If the program seems slow:
1. This is normal for the first run (it's setting things up)
2. Future runs will be faster
3. Try using fewer seeds if it's too slow

### If you get a connection error:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure the website is accessible
3. Try running the program again

## Need Help?
If something's not working:
1. Make sure you have an internet connection
2. Check that you installed all required packages
3. Make sure you ran the `playwright install` command
4. Try with just one or two seeds first

Remember: This program is super easy to use! Just enter some seed numbers, type 's' when you're done, and let it add up all the numbers for you! ðŸ”¢ âž•
