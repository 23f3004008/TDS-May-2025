# Hacker News Post Finder - User Guide

## What This Program Does
This program helps you find the newest posts on Hacker News that match your interests! It's like having a personal assistant that watches Hacker News and tells you when there's a new post about a topic you care about. You can also make sure you only see popular posts by setting a minimum points requirement!

## Requirements Before Running
Before you start, you'll need to install one special tool. It's super easy!

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and run this command:
   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Running the Program
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Go to the folder containing `hn.py`
3. Type: `python hn.py` and press Enter

### 2. Using the Program
The program will ask you two questions:

1. **Enter the text to search for in Hacker News posts:**
   - Type any word or phrase given in the question
   - Examples:
     - `python` to find posts about Python
     - `artificial intelligence` to find AI posts
     - `startup` to find startup-related posts

2. **Enter the minimum points threshold:**
   - Type a number (like `10` or `50`)
   - This helps you find posts that are popular
   - Higher numbers mean more popular posts
   - Example: `10` means show posts with at least 10 points

## Common Problems and Solutions

### If you don't find any posts:
1. Try a lower points threshold
2. Use simpler search terms
3. Make sure your search term isn't too specific
4. Try searching for a single word instead of a phrase

### If the program shows an error:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Make sure you entered a valid number for points
3. Try running the program again

## Need Help?
If something's not working:
1. Make sure you have an internet connection

3. Make sure you're entering a valid number for points
4. Try closing and reopening your terminal/command prompt
