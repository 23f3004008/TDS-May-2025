# Creating Your Daily GitHub Workflow - Step by Step Guide üöÄ

Don't worry if you're new to this! Just follow these simple steps and you'll be done in no time.

## Step 1: Create a New Repository 

1. Open your web browser and go to [GitHub's New Repository Page](https://github.com/new)
   - If you're not signed in, GitHub will ask you to sign in first
   - Use your GitHub username and password to sign in

2. Once you're on the "Create a new repository" page:
   - Type a name for your repository (for example: `daily-commit-workflow`)
   - Make sure "Public" is selected (it has a green dot next to it)
   - Look for a checkbox that says "Add a README file" and check it 
   - Find the big green "Create repository" button at the bottom and click it

## Step 2: Add the Special Workflow File 

1. In your new repository, look for a button that says "Add file" (it's near the top)
   - Click it and choose "Create new file"

2. At the top where it says "Name your file...", type exactly this:
   ```
   .github/workflows/daily-commit.yml
   ```

3. Copy and paste the following code into the big text box:
   ```yaml
   name: Daily Commit

   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: '15 4 * * *'
     workflow_dispatch:

   jobs:
     commit:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v3
           with:
             token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

         - name: Commit step - [YOUR-EMAIL-HERE]
           run: |
             echo "TDSFU Daily run: $(date -u) TDSFU" >> daily-log.txt

         - name: Git Commit and Push
           run: |
             git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
             git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
             git add daily-log.txt
             git commit -m "Auto commit at $(date -u)" || echo "No changes to commit"
             git push
   ```

4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Replace `[YOUR-EMAIL-HERE]` with your actual email address!

5. Save the file:
   - Scroll down to find the green "Commit changes..." button
   - Click it
   - In the popup window, click "Commit changes" again

## Step 3: Set Up Permissions 

1. Look at the top of your repository page for a tab called "Settings"
   - Click on "Settings"

2. On the left side of the screen:
   - Find and click on "Actions"
   - Then click on "General"

3. Scroll down until you see "Workflow permissions":
   - Click the option that says "Read and write permissions"
   - Click the "Save" button

## Step 4: Run the Workflow 

1. Go back to the top of your repository and click the "Actions" tab

2. On the left side, click "Daily Commit"

3. Look for a button that says "Run workflow":
   - Click the dropdown arrow next to it
   - Click the green "Run workflow" button

4. Wait a few seconds, then refresh your page:
   - You should see your workflow running
   - Wait until you see a green checkmark 
   - This means it worked!

## Step 5: Submit Your Work 

1. Look at the address bar in your browser
2. Copy the entire URL of your repository
3. This URL is what you'll submit as your answer

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Important Notes:

- Make sure you see the green checkmark ‚úÖ in the Actions tab
- The workflow must have run successfully in the last 5 minutes
- Double-check that you replaced `[YOUR-EMAIL-HERE]` with your actual email
- Keep your browser window open until you've submitted your answer
