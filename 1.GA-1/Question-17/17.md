# Generating Embeddings Using AI Proxy in WSL

This guide will help you generate embeddings for text using the AI Proxy service through WSL.

## ⚠️ Important: Read Before Starting

- You have a monthly limit of $0.5 - be careful not to exceed it
- Each embedding request costs money, so verify your command before running
- Run the command only ONCE after thorough verification
- The service tracks usage by email address

## Prerequisites

1. WSL with Ubuntu installed (refer to [WSL Setup Guide](../0.Setup/WSL.md))
2. Your IITM email account (format: `rollnumber@ds.study.iitm.ac.in`)

## Step 1: Get Your AI Proxy Token

1. Visit [AI Proxy Service](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/)
2. Sign in with your IITM email account
3. Copy the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` provided after login
   > 💡 Keep this token secure - it's your authentication key

## Step 2: Access WSL

1. Open your terminal
2. Enter WSL:
   ```powershell
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```
   > 💡 You'll know you're in WSL when you see your Ubuntu username in the prompt

## Step 3: Prepare and Verify Command

1. Store your token as a variable (replace `your_token_here` with your actual token):
   ```bash
   export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   ```

2. Before running, verify these elements in your command:
   - Your token is correctly set (echo $AIPROXY_TOKEN to check)
   - Your email address is correctly formatted
   - The model name is exactly "text-embedding-3-small"
   - The JSON is properly formatted with no typos

3. Command template - DO NOT RUN YET:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $AIPROXY_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": "My email is your email address here"}'
   ```

## Step 4: Execute Command (ONCE Only)

After verification:
1. Replace "your email address here" with your actual email / whats given in the question in the input parameter
2. Double-check the entire command
3. Run the command ONCE only
4. Save the response for your records

## Understanding the Response

The response will include:
- An array of embeddings (vector representations)
- Usage information
- Cost details in the headers

## Verification Checklist

Before running, verify:
- [ ] WSL is properly running
- [ ] Token is correctly exported
- [ ] Email address is correct
- [ ] Command syntax is exact
- [ ] You haven't run this command before

## Troubleshooting

- If you need to check your current usage:
  - Look at the `monthlyCost` header in the response
  - Keep track of your requests
- If the token is invalid:
  - Verify you're using your IITM email
  - Try logging in to the AI Proxy service again
- If curl fails:
  - Check your internet connection
  - Verify the token is correctly formatted

## Cost Management

- Each request contributes to your $0.5 monthly limit
- Keep track of your usage through response headers
- Don't experiment with multiple runs
- Save your response for future reference
