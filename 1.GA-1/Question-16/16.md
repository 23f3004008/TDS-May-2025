# Text Replacement and Hash Calculation Guide

This guide shows how to replace "IITM" with "IIT Madras" in all files and calculate the SHA256 hash using VS Code and WSL.

## Steps

1. **Unzip and Open Files**
   - Unzip the downloaded files into a new folder
   - Open this folder in VS Code

2. **Replace Text Using VS Code**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + F` to open global search
   - Enable "Match Case" to ensure you catch all variants
   - In the search box, type: `IITM`
   - In the replace box, type: `IIT Madras`
   - Click "Replace All"
   - VS Code will show how many replacements were made
   - Save all files (`Ctrl + K S`)

3. **Calculate Hash Using WSL**
   - Open terminal (either VS Code terminal with `Ctrl + ~` or your system terminal)
   - If using Windows, make sure you're in WSL:
     ```powershell
     wsl -d Ubuntu
     ```
     > ðŸ’¡ You can check if you're already in WSL by looking at the terminal prompt - it should show your Ubuntu username
   - Navigate to the folder containing your updated files:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/folder
     ```
   - Run this exact command:
     ```bash
     cat * | sha256sum
     ```
   - Copy the resulting hash (64 characters)

## Important Notes

- Don't modify anything else in the files
- The replacement should catch "IITM" in any case (upper, lower, mixed)
- Make sure all files are saved before running the hash command
- The hash will be a 64-character hexadecimal string

## Troubleshooting

- If WSL terminal doesn't show Ubuntu:
  - Click the + dropdown in terminal
  - Select "Ubuntu (WSL)"
- If the folder path has spaces:
  - Use quotes: `cd "Your Folder Name"`
- If files aren't showing in WSL:
  - Check if you're in the correct directory using `pwd`
  - Use `ls` to list files

## Expected Output

The output will be a 64-character hexadecimal string, which is the SHA256 hash of the concatenated file contents after replacement.
