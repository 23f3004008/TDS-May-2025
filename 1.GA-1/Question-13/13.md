# Finding Sum of Featured Sale Discounts

This guide helps you calculate the sum of discounts for products with both 'featured' and 'sale' classes.

## Opening Chrome DevTools

1. Right-click anywhere on the webpage
2. Select "Inspect" or press:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + I`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Option + I`

## Accessing the Console

1. Click the "Console" tab in DevTools
2. If you see a warning about pasting, type exactly:
   ```
   allow pasting
   ```
3. Press Enter

## The Code to Run

Copy this exact code:
```javascript
Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.featured.sale, .sale.featured'))
    .reduce((sum, item) => sum + Number(item.dataset.discount), 0)
```

## Steps to Get the Result

1. Open DevTools Console
2. If you see "Paste is blocked. Type 'allow pasting' to allow":
   - Type `allow pasting` and press Enter
   - This is a one-time security step
3. Paste the code
4. Press Enter
5. Copy the number that appears in the output

## Understanding the Code

- `.featured.sale, .sale.featured` finds elements with both classes
- `dataset.discount` gets the discount percentage
- `reduce` adds up all the discounts
- The result is the sum of all discounts

## Important Security Note

- Chrome blocks pasting in Console by default
- This is to protect against malicious code
- Type 'allow pasting' when prompted
- This warning appears only for new users
- Once allowed, pasting will work normally

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see the correct result:
- Make sure DevTools is focused on the right page
- Verify that the elements are in the DOM
- Check that the classes are spelled correctly
- Ensure the data-discount attributes are present
