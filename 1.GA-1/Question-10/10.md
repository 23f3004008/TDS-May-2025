# Processing Product Catalog JSON Data

This guide helps you filter and sort product catalog data according to specific criteria.

## Configuration Options

At the top of `product_processor.py`, you'll find a CONFIG dictionary where you can modify:

1. Minimum Price Threshold:
   ```python
   'MIN_PRICE': 69.02  # Change this value to set different price threshold
   ```

2. Sorting Options:
   ```python
   'SORT_OPTIONS': {
       'category': {
           'ascending': True,    # True for A→Z, False for Z→A
           'priority': 1         # 1 means sort by this first
       },
       'price': {
           'ascending': False,   # False for highest→lowest, True for lowest→highest
           'priority': 2         # 2 means sort by this second
       },
       'name': {
           'ascending': True,    # True for A→Z, False for Z→A
           'priority': 3         # 3 means sort by this third
       }
   }
   ```

## Default Settings

By default, the script will:
1. Remove products with price < 69.02
2. Sort remaining products by:
   - Category (A→Z)
   - Then Price (highest→lowest)
   - Then Name (A→Z)

## How to Use the Script

1. (Optional) Modify the CONFIG settings at the top of the script
2. Run `product_processor.py`
3. Review the current configuration displayed
4. When prompted, paste your JSON data and press Enter
5. Getting the Result:
   - Make your terminal full screen
   - Scroll up slightly to find "Processed Result:"
   - Copy ONLY the text after "Processed Result:" (the minified JSON)
   - Don't include any extra spaces before or after the JSON
   - Don't include the "Processed Result:" text itself

## Example Input Format
```json
[
    {"category":"Home","price":33.11,"name":"Ultra Gadget"},
    {"category":"Electronics","price":93.37,"name":"Super Set"}
]
```

## Understanding the Output

- The script will show current configuration settings
- The output will be a minified JSON string
- All products under the minimum price will be removed
- Products will be sorted according to your configuration
- Default sort order is category → price → name

## Important Notes

- Make sure to copy the entire JSON array
- The input should be valid JSON format
- Don't modify the structure of the JSON
- When copying the result:
  - Look for "Processed Result:" in the output
  - Copy ONLY the line below it
  - Don't include any blank lines or spaces
  - Don't include the "Processed Result:" text
- You can change sort priorities and directions in the CONFIG
- Price threshold can be modified in the CONFIG
