# Finding Hidden Input Value Using Developer Tools

This guide will help you find the hidden value in the webpage using browser developer tools.

## Step 1: Open Developer Tools

1. Right-click on the text "Just above this paragraph, there's a hidden input with a secret value"
2. Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu
   - In Chrome: Right-click → "Inspect"
   - In Firefox: Right-click → "Inspect Element"
   - In Edge: Right-click → "Inspect"

## Step 2: Locate the Hidden Input

1. The developer tools will open, highlighting the paragraph you clicked
2. Look just above the highlighted line
3. You should see an HTML element that looks like this:
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" value="VALUE_HERE">
   ```

## Step 3: Get the Value

1. The value you need is in the `value` attribute
2. Copy the text between the quotes after `value=`
   - Don't include the quotes
   - Don't include any spaces before or after
   - Copy exactly as shown

## Important Notes

- The value is case-sensitive
- Make sure you're looking at the correct hidden input (it should be just above the paragraph)
- The value will be different for each person
- Don't share your specific value with others

## Troubleshooting

If you can't find the value:
1. Make sure you're inspecting the correct paragraph
2. Try collapsing and expanding the HTML elements
3. Use the search function in developer tools (usually Ctrl+F)
4. Look for the `<div class="mb-3">` container
5. The hidden input should be the first element inside this div
