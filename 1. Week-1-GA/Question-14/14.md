# Processing Multi-Encoded Data Files

This guide helps you process files with different encodings and sum values for specific symbols.

## The Task

Process three differently encoded files and sum values where symbol is '›' OR 'œ':
- `data1.csv`: CP-1252 encoding (Windows)
- `data2.csv`: UTF-8 encoding
- `data3.txt`: UTF-16 encoding, tab-separated

## File Format

Each file contains two columns:
```
symbol,value    # For CSV files
symbol<tab>value    # For TSV file
```

## How to Use the Script

1. Download and extract all three files to the same folder as the script
2. (Optional) Configure target symbols:
   - Open `encoding_processor.py`
   - Locate the `TARGET_SYMBOLS` section at the top
   - Modify the symbols as needed:
   ```python
   TARGET_SYMBOLS = {'›', 'œ'}  # Modify these symbols as needed
   ```
3. Run `encoding_processor.py`
4. The script will:
   - Read each file with its correct encoding
   - Find rows with the specified symbols
   - Sum their values
   - Display the total as an integer

## Output

The script will show only the final sum as an integer number. This is the value you should use as your answer.

## Important Notes

- Make sure all files are in the same directory as the script
- Don't modify the file encodings
- The script handles:
  - CSV files (comma-separated)
  - TSV files (tab-separated)
  - Different encodings (CP-1252, UTF-8, UTF-16)
- The output is automatically rounded to an integer
- You can customize the target symbols by modifying the `TARGET_SYMBOLS` configuration
- For programmatic use, you can also pass custom symbols when creating the processor:
  ```python
  processor = EncodingProcessor(target_symbols={'your', 'symbols'})
  ```
