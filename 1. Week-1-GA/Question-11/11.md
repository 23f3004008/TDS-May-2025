# Comparing Configuration Changes

This guide helps you identify changes between two configuration JSON files.

## The Task

Compare two configuration files (`config_old.json` and `config_new.json`) to find:
- Number of settings that have different values
- Each file contains 425 configuration objects or changed based on the question
- Only compare the `value` field for each setting

## How to Use the Script

1. Download and extract both JSON files to the same folder as the script
2. Run `config_compare.py`
3. The script will automatically:
   - Load both configuration files
   - Compare values for each setting
   - Display the total number of changes

## File Format

Each JSON file contains an array of objects with this structure:
```json
{
    "key": "setting_name",
    "value": "setting_value",
    "defaultValue": "default_value",
    "enabled": true/false
}
```

## Understanding the Output

The script will show:
- Total number of settings that changed
- No need to copy anything else
- Just use the number shown as your answer

## Important Notes

- Make sure both JSON files are in the same directory as the script
- The script only compares the `value` field
- Changes in other fields (enabled, defaultValue) are ignored
- The comparison is case-sensitive
- Make sure to copy only the number from the result
