# Calculating Weekend Days in a Date Range

This guide helps you calculate the number of weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays) between two dates.

## The Problem
Calculate the number of weekend days between:
- Start date: 1989-12-19
- End date: 2007-07-03
- Include both start and end dates in the calculation

## Solution Method

You can use the provided Python script `weekend_calculator.py` to find the answer:

1. The script uses Python's `datetime` module
2. Simply run the script with the given dates
3. The script will count all Saturdays and Sundays in the range
4. The result includes both the start and end dates if they fall on weekends

## How to Use the Script

1. Open `weekend_calculator.py`
2. The dates are already set at the top of the file
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python weekend_calculator.py
   ```
4. The script will show:
   - Total number of weekend days
   - Breakdown of Saturdays and Sundays

## Understanding the Output

The script will show:
- Number of Saturdays in the range
- Number of Sundays in the range
- Total weekend days (Saturdays + Sundays)

## Want to Calculate Different Dates?

Just modify the dates at the top of `weekend_calculator.py`:
```python
START_DATE = "1989-12-19"  # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
END_DATE = "2007-07-03"    # Format: YYYY-MM-DD
```
