# File Processing: Move and Rename

This guide helps you process files from `q-move-rename-files.zip` by moving them to a single folder and renaming them according to specific rules.

## Requirements

The script will:
1. Extract files from the zip
2. Move all files from subfolders to a new folder
3. Rename files by replacing each digit with the next number:
   - 1 → 2
   - 2 → 3
   - ...
   - 9 → 0
   - Example: `a1b9c.txt` becomes `a2b0c.txt`
4. Calculate and display the hash

## Using the Script

1. Open WSL terminal:
   ```powershell
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```

2. Make sure you're in the directory containing:
   - `q-move-rename-files.zip`
   - `process_files.sh`

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x process_files.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./process_files.sh
   ```

The script will automatically:
- Create directory `q-move-rename-files`
- Extract the zip preserving timestamps
- Create subfolder `nf` for processed files
- Move and rename files according to rules
- Run the hash command

## Understanding the Process

1. File Movement:
   - All files from subdirectories are moved to `nf/`
   - Original directory structure is flattened

2. File Renaming:
   - Each digit is replaced with the next number
   - 9 wraps around to 0
   - Non-digit characters remain unchanged

3. Hash Calculation:
   ```bash
   grep . * | LC_ALL=C sort | sha256sum
   ```
   This command:
   - Greps all file contents
   - Sorts them consistently
   - Generates a SHA256 hash

## Troubleshooting

If you get errors:
1. Check file permissions:
   ```bash
   ls -l process_files.sh
   ```

2. Verify the zip file:
   ```bash
   ls -l q-move-rename-files.zip
   ```

3. Check processed files:
   ```bash
   cd q-move-rename-files/nf
   ls -la
   ```

4. Verify file renaming:
   ```bash
   # Example of how digits change:
   # Original: file123.txt
   # Renamed:  file234.txt
   ```
