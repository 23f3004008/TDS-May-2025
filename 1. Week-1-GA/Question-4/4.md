# Getting README File Hash Using Prettier

This guide will help you download, locate, and process the README file to get its hash value.

## Step 1: Download and Locate the File

1. Download the README file from the question
2. Note where the file is saved (usually in Downloads folder)
   - Default location: `C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads`
   - Or any other folder of your choice

## Step 2: Open Terminal in File Location

### Method 1: Right-Click Method (Preferred)
1. Navigate to the folder containing README.md in File Explorer
2. Right-click in the folder (not on any file)
3. Look for "Open in Terminal" or "Open Linux shell here"
4. Select it to open WSL terminal in that location

### Method 2: Manual Navigation (If Method 1 isn't available)
1. Open WSL terminal ([see WSL Setup Guide](../../0.Setup/WSL.md) for details)
   ```bash
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```

2. Navigate to your folder:
   ```bash
   # If file is in Downloads folder
   cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Downloads
   
   # OR use the copied path from File Explorer
   # Replace the path with what you copied
   cd "/mnt/c/Path/To/Your/Folder"
   ```

## Step 3: Run the Command

1. Make sure you're in the correct directory:
   ```bash
   ls
   # Should show README.md in the output
   ```

2. Run the prettier command:
   ```bash
   npx -y prettier@3.4.2 README.md | sha256sum
   ```

## Step 4: Get the Hash

1. The command will output a hash value that looks like this:
   ```
   64-character-hash  -
   ```

2. Copy **only** the hash value (the 64 characters before the space and dash)

## Important Notes

- Make sure the README.md filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- The hash should be exactly 64 characters long
- Don't include the `-` or any spaces in your answer
- If you get any errors:
  - Verify you're in the correct directory
  - Check that the file name is exactly `README.md`
  - Ensure you have an internet connection (needed for npx)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Verify the file exists using `ls`
2. Check file permissions
3. Make sure WSL is properly installed
4. Try running `npx` with a clean cache:
   ```bash
   npx clear-npx-cache
   ```
   Then try the command again
