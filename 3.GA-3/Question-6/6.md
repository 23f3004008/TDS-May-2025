# AIrtGallery Similarity Calculator Solution

## Task Overview
Calculate the similarity score (dot product) between an image of "Tangram puzzle pieces" and the text description using Jina AI's CLIP V2 model.

## Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Set Up Jina AI Account and Get API Key
1. Visit [Jina AI Embeddings](https://jina.ai/embeddings/)
2. Click "Log In" and sign in with your GitHub account (or create a new account)
3. After logging in, navigate to the API Key section
4. Generate a new API key if you don't already have one
5. Copy and save your API key securely

### 2. Prepare the Image and Text
- Image: Download the images from the question
- Text: Chinese text from the question

### 3. Calculate Similarity Using the Python Program
- Created a Python program (`similarity_calculator.py`) that:
- Takes your Jina API key, image path, and text description as input
- Calls the Jina AI API to generate embeddings for both the image and text
- Calculates the cosine similarity (dot product of normalized vectors)
- Returns the similarity score with 6 decimal places

### 4. Code Explanation
The program:
1. Reads and encodes the image to base64
2. Sends both the text and image to Jina's unified `/v1/embeddings` endpoint
3. Extracts the normalized embedding vectors from the response
4. Calculates the dot product to find the similarity score

### 5. How to Run the Program
```bash
python similarity_calculator.py
```

When prompted:
- Enter your Jina API key
- Enter the path to your image file
- Enter the text description from the question (Copy paste without space from the start & end)

### 6. Understanding the Results
The similarity score will be a value between -1 and 1:
- Closer to 1: Higher similarity
- Closer to 0: Little to no relationship
- Closer to -1: Opposite meaning

For the specific image (Tangram puzzle pieces) and text (about backpropagation algorithm), we expect a low to moderate similarity score since they aren't directly related concepts.

### 7. Technical Details
- Model used: `jina-clip-v2`
- Vector dimensions: 1024
- Normalization: L2 normalization (magnitude = 1)
- Similarity metric: Cosine similarity (dot product of normalized vectors)

The final similarity score with at least 4 decimal places: [Run the program to get the actual score]
