# Text Similarity API Server Setup

## Overview
This guide will help you set up and run a FastAPI server that calculates text similarity using OpenAI's text embeddings.

## Prerequisites
- Python with FastAPI, httpx, numpy, and scikit-learn installed
- IITM email account for AIProxy access

## Steps

1. **Get your AIProxy Token**
   - Visit https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/
   - Sign in using your IITM email account
   - Copy your API token from the dashboard

2. **Update the Python Script**
   - Open `main.py` in your preferred editor
   - Find the line with `AIPROXY_TOKEN = "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"`
   - Replace `"YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"` with your actual AIProxy token
   - Save the file

3. **Run the Server**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - The server will start running at http://127.0.0.1:8808
   - Keep this terminal window open and the server running

4. **Verify Server is Running**
   - The API endpoint will be available at:
     http://127.0.0.1:8808/similarity
   - Keep the server running throughout the assignment

## Important Notes
- Do not share your AIProxy token
- The server must remain running for the duration of the assignment
- The endpoint accepts POST requests with documents and a query
- Returns up to 3 most similar documents with their similarity scores
