# Text Embedding Generation Instructions

Follow these steps to generate embeddings for two messages:

1. **Locate the Question Text**
   - Find the question that contains the two messages you need to embed
   - Identify the first and second messages that need embedding

2. **Update the Python Script**
   - Open the `embed_json.py` file in a text editor
   - Find these lines near the top of the file:
     ```python
     message_1 = "First message"
     message_2 = "Second message"
     ```
   - Replace "First message" with the exact text of the first message from the question
   - Replace "Second message" with the exact text of the second message from the question
   - Save the file

3. **Run the Script**
   - Execute the Python script using your preferred method:
     ```
     python embed_json.py
     ```
   - The script will generate a JSON payload for the text-embedding-3-small model

4. **Submit the Answer**
   - Copy the entire JSON output from the script
   - Paste it as your answer to the question

The output JSON will show the payload that would be sent to the OpenAI API to generate embeddings for both messages.
