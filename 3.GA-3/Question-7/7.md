# Finding Similar Customer Feedback with Embeddings

Your task is to write a Python function `most_similar(embeddings)` that will calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of these embeddings and return the pair that has the highest similarity. The result should be a tuple of the two phrases that are most similar.

## Solution

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import combinations

def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):
    vec1 = np.array(vec1)
    vec2 = np.array(vec2)
    return np.dot(vec1, vec2) / (np.linalg.norm(vec1) * np.linalg.norm(vec2))

def most_similar(embeddings):
    max_similarity = -1  # Initialize with lowest possible similarity
    most_similar_pair = (None, None)
    
    # Generate all unique pairs of phrases
    for phrase1, phrase2 in combinations(embeddings.keys(), 2):
        sim = cosine_similarity(embeddings[phrase1], embeddings[phrase2])
        if sim > max_similarity:
            max_similarity = sim
            most_similar_pair = (phrase1, phrase2)
    
    return most_similar_pair
```

## Explanation

The solution uses the following approach:

1. Define a function `cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)` that computes the cosine similarity between two vectors:
   - Convert the input vectors to NumPy arrays
   - Calculate the dot product of the vectors
   - Divide by the product of their magnitudes (L2 norms)

2. Define the main function `most_similar(embeddings)` that:
   - Initializes variables to track the maximum similarity and the corresponding phrase pair
   - Uses `combinations` from the `itertools` module to generate all unique pairs of phrases
   - For each pair, computes the cosine similarity and updates the maximum if a higher similarity is found
   - Returns the pair of phrases with the highest similarity

This approach efficiently compares all possible pairs of phrases exactly once and identifies the most semantically similar feedback.

## Notes

- Cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1, where:
  - 1 indicates identical direction (perfect similarity)
  - 0 indicates orthogonality (no similarity)
  - -1 indicates opposite direction (perfect dissimilarity)
  
- For the given embeddings, the function will return the pair of phrases that have the most similar meaning according to their vector representations, which helps ShopSmart identify related customer feedback topics.
