# Image Brightness Analysis in Google Colab

This guide shows how to analyze the brightness of an image using Google Colab. We'll count the number of pixels with a lightness value greater than 0.663.

## The Image

The image to analyze is available at: https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/lenna.webp

## Method 1: Upload the Image from Your Computer

1. First, download the image from https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/lenna.webp to your computer:
   - Visit the URL in your browser
   - Right-click on the image and select "Save Image As..."
   - Save it as "lenna.webp"

2. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

3. Create a new notebook

4. Copy and paste the following corrected code into a cell:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from google.colab import files
import colorsys

# Fixed code: added parentheses to call the keys() method
image = Image.open(list(files.upload().keys())[0])

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.663)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.663: {light_pixels}')
```

5. Run the cell by clicking the play button or pressing Shift+Enter

6. When prompted, upload the "lenna.webp" file from your computer

7. The code will process the image and display the number of pixels with lightness > 0.663

## Method 2: Download the Image Directly in Colab

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. Create a new notebook

3. Copy and paste the following code into a cell to download the image directly:

```python
!wget https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/lenna.webp -O lenna.webp
```

4. Run the cell to download the image

5. In a new cell, copy and paste the following code:

```python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
import colorsys

# Load the downloaded image
image = Image.open("lenna.webp")

rgb = np.array(image) / 255.0
lightness = np.apply_along_axis(lambda x: colorsys.rgb_to_hls(*x)[1], 2, rgb)
light_pixels = np.sum(lightness > 0.663)
print(f'Number of pixels with lightness > 0.663: {light_pixels}')
```

6. Run this cell to process the image and display the result
