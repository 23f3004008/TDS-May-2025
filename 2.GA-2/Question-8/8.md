# Creating and Pushing a Docker Image to Docker Hub

This guide walks you through the process of installing Docker, creating a Docker image, and pushing it to Docker Hub with a specific tag.

## Step 1: Install Docker Desktop on Windows

1. Download Docker Desktop for Windows:
   - Go to the [Docker Desktop website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Click on "Download for Windows"

2. Install Docker Desktop:
   - Run the downloaded installer
   - Follow the installation wizard
   - When prompted, select "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" (recommended)
   - Click "OK" to install required Windows components

3. Restart your computer after installation

4. After restart, Docker Desktop should start automatically
   - Look for the Docker icon in the system tray
   - It may take a few minutes to initialize on first run

## Step 2: Verify Docker Installation

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
   ```
   docker --version
   ```

2. Test Docker with a simple container:
   ```
   docker run hello-world
   ```
   You should see a message confirming Docker is working correctly.

## Step 3: Create a Docker Hub Account

1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and click "Sign Up"
2. Fill in the registration form with your information
3. Verify your email address

## Step 4: Log in to Docker Hub

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Log in to Docker Hub:
   ```
   docker login
   ```
3. Enter your Docker Hub username and password when prompted

## Step 5: Create a Project Directory

1. Create a new directory for your Docker project:
   ```
   mkdir docker-hello-world
   cd docker-hello-world
   ```

## Step 6: Create a Simple Python Application

1. Create a file named `app.py` with a simple Python script:
   ```python
   print("Hello from my Docker container!")
   ```

   You can do this with a text editor or from the command line:
   ```
   echo print("Hello from my Docker container!") > app.py
   ```

## Step 7: Create a Dockerfile

1. In the same directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension):
   ```
   FROM python:3.9-slim
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   COPY app.py .
   
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

   This Dockerfile:
   - Uses the Python 3.9 slim image as a base
   - Sets the working directory to /app
   - Copies your app.py file into the container
   - Specifies the command to run when the container starts

## Step 8: Build the Docker Image

1. Build your Docker image with a name and tag:
   ```
   docker build -t yourusername/hello-python:latest .
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with your Docker Hub username.

2. Verify the image was created:
   ```
   docker images
   ```

## Step 9: Test Your Docker Image Locally

1. Run your Docker image:
   ```
   docker run yourusername/hello-python:latest
   ```
   You should see the output: "Hello from my Docker container!"

## Step 10: Tag Your Image with a Specific Tag

1. Add the specific tag `your roll number / from question` to your image:
   ```
   docker tag yourusername/hello-python:latest yourusername/hello-python:rollnumber
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` & `rollnumber` with your Docker Hub username & the rollnumber/id from the question.

## Step 11: Push Your Images to Docker Hub

1. Push the 'latest' tag:
   ```
   docker push yourusername/hello-python:latest
   ```

2. Push the 'rollnumber' tag:
   ```
   docker push yourusername/hello-python:rollnumber
   ```
Replace `rollnumber` and `yourusername`

## Step 12: Verify Your Image on Docker Hub

1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to "Repositories"
4. Click on your repository (hello-python)
5. Verify that both tags (latest and 23f3004008) are listed under "Tags"

Your Docker image URL will be:
```
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/yourusername/hello-python/general
```

Replace `yourusername` with your Docker Hub username.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. If Docker Desktop fails to start:
   - Check that Virtualization is enabled in your BIOS
   - Ensure WSL 2 is properly installed

2. If you can't push to Docker Hub:
   - Verify you're logged in with `docker login`
   - Check that your image name starts with your Docker Hub username

3. If the build fails:
   - Check your Dockerfile for syntax errors
   - Ensure your app.py file is in the same directory

4. If you get "permission denied":
   - On Windows, try running Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
   - On Linux/Mac, you might need to use `sudo` with Docker commands

## Additional Docker Commands

- List all containers: `docker ps -a`
- Stop a container: `docker stop container_id`
- Remove a container: `docker rm container_id`
- Remove an image: `docker rmi image_name`
- View container logs: `docker logs container_id`
