# Exposing Ollama to the Internet with ngrok

This guide walks you through setting up Ollama with CORS enabled and exposing it to the internet using ngrok on Windows.

## Step 1: Configure Ollama with CORS Support

First, you need to set the `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` environment variable to enable CORS:

1. Close Ollama if it's currently running:
   - Find the Ollama icon in the Windows system tray (bottom right of taskbar)
   - Right-click on it and select "Quit Ollama"

2. Set the environment variable in Windows:

   **Temporary (Command Prompt):**
   ```
   set OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*
   ```

   **Temporary (PowerShell):**
   ```
   $env:OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"
   ```

   **Permanent (System Settings):**
   - Right-click on "This PC" or "My Computer" and select "Properties"
   - Click on "Advanced system settings"
   - Click the "Environment Variables" button
   - In the "System variables" section, click "New"
   - Variable name: `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`
   - Variable value: `*`
   - Click "OK" on all dialogs

3. Start Ollama again:
   - If you set the variable temporarily, open Command Prompt and run:
     ```
     ollama serve
     ```
   - If you set it permanently, you can start Ollama from the Start menu

## Step 2: Download and Install ngrok

1. Download ngrok for Windows:
   - Go to: https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-windows-amd64.zip
   - Or download from the official site: https://ngrok.com/download

2. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice (e.g., `C:\ngrok`)

## Step 3: Create an ngrok Account and Get Your Auth Token

1. Sign up for ngrok:
   - Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
   - Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email

2. Get your auth token:
   - After signing in, go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
   - Copy your authtoken

## Step 4: Configure ngrok

1. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted ngrok:
   ```
   cd C:\path\to\ngrok
   ```

2. Add your auth token:
   ```
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the token you copied from the ngrok dashboard.

## Step 5: Start ngrok to Expose Ollama

1. Make sure Ollama is running with CORS enabled

2. In the Command Prompt (in the ngrok directory), run this exact command:
   ```
   http 11434 --response-header-add "X-Email: your email" --response-header-add "Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Email" --response-header-add "Access-Control-Allow-Headers: ngrok-skip-browser-warning" --response-header-add 'Access-Control-Expose-Headers: *'
   ```

   Note: This command includes:
   - Your email address in the X-Email header
   - Exposes the X-Email header for CORS access
   - Allows the ngrok-skip-browser-warning header in requests

3. ngrok will display a forwarding URL that looks like:
   ```
   Forwarding https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:11434
   ```

4. Copy this HTTPS forwarding URL. This is the URL you will submit.

## Step 6: Verify the Setup

To verify that everything is working correctly:

1. Directly visit your ngrok URL + `/api/version` in your browser (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app/api/version`)
2. You should see a JSON response with the Ollama version information
3. Check the response headers in your browser's Developer Tools (F12 > Network tab)

## Important Notes

1. **Retrying if necessary**: If the automated tests fail, try:
   - Refreshing the ngrok tunnel by stopping (Ctrl+C) and restarting the ngrok command
   - Checking the ngrok dashboard at http://localhost:4040 to inspect requests and responses
   - Trying a different browser to test the endpoint
   - Making sure you've copied the exact forwarding URL provided by ngrok

2. **Cache issues**: Browser caching can sometimes interfere with testing:
   - Use incognito/private browsing mode
   - Add a cache-busting parameter to your URL (e.g., `?t=123`)
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Try a different browser

3. **Formatting the URL correctly**:
   - Do not add a trailing slash to the URL
   - Use the exact URL provided by ngrok

4. **Keep the Command Prompt window with ngrok running open** during testing.

## Troubleshooting

- If you're still getting CORS errors, try restarting Ollama and checking that the OLLAMA_ORIGINS environment variable is set correctly
- If the ngrok tunnel isn't working, check that the port (11434) is correct and that Ollama is running
- If your browser shows security warnings, this is normal for ngrok tunnels and can be safely bypassed for testing
- If the automated testing system continues to fail, try getting a new ngrok URL by restarting the tunnel
