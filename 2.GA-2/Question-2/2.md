# Image Compression Challenge

## Problem Statement
eShopCo, a global e-commerce platform, needs to deliver product images efficiently. By ensuring each image is losslessly compressed below 400 bytes, they can:
- Reduce page load times by 30%
- Improve search ranking
- Cut bandwidth costs
- Maintain crystal-clear visuals for customer engagement

## Approach
1. Download the target image
2. Use the image_analysis.py script to analyze & compress the original image
3. Try the compressed_q2image_lossless.webp first and if that does not work then try other images
4. Verify the file size is below 400 bytes

## Results
After analyzing the compression results, the WebP lossless format provided the best lossless compression while maintaining perfect image quality.

The compressed file "compressed_q2image_lossless.webp" meets the requirements of being:
- Losslessly compressed (100% identical to the original)
- Less than 400 bytes in size

This solution allows eShopCo to maintain image quality while achieving significant performance and cost benefits.
