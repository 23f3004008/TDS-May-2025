# Generating a Session Code in Google Colab

This guide shows how to create a session code by hashing an email address with the current year in Google Colab.

## Background

eShopCo needs a way to retrieve customer session logs without exposing raw emails in filenames. They generate a "session code" by hashing the customer's email with the current year, which is used to index into their log bucket.

## Steps to Generate Your Session Code

1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Copy and paste the following code (with fixes) into a code cell:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import requests
import hashlib
from google.colab import auth
from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials

# Authenticate user
auth.authenticate_user()
creds = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default()

# Get access token
token = creds.get_access_token().access_token

# Fetch user email
response = requests.get(
  "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo",
  params={"alt": "json"},
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
)

# Extract email from response
email = response.json()["email"]
print(f"Your email: {email}")

# Generate session code
from datetime import datetime
current_year = datetime.now().year
session_code = hashlib.sha256(f"{email} {current_year}".encode()).hexdigest()[-5:]
print(f"Your session code: {session_code}")
```

4. Run the cell by clicking the play button on the left side of the cell or press Shift+Enter

5. If prompted, click "Connect" to connect to a runtime

6. Authentication process:
   - A popup window will appear asking you to "Choose an account"
   - Select your account
   - Next, you'll see "Google Colab wants to access your Google Account"
   - Click "Continue" to give the notebook permission to access your Google account
   - When it says "The authentication flow has completed," return to the notebook

7. The code will run automatically after authentication and display:
   - Your email address
   - Your session code (a 5-character string)

8. Copy your session code:
   - Highlight just the 5-character code (not the "Your session code:" text)
   - Right-click and select "Copy" or press Ctrl+C
   - This is the answer to the question

## Fixes Made to the Original Code

1. Added the missing `requests` import
2. Added the missing `hashlib` import 
3. Fixed the year value - the original code referred to `creds.token_expiry.year` which may not be reliable, so we're using the current year instead
