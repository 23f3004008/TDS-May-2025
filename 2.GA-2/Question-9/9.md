# Setting Up a GitHub Codespace

This guide demonstrates how to create a GitHub Codespace for a new repository and run the required command to display environment variables.

## Creating a New Repository and Launching a Codespace

Follow these steps to complete the eShopCo onboarding project:

### Step 1: Create a New Public Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page
3. Select "New repository" from the dropdown menu
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., "eshopco-onboarding") or anything
   - Add a short description (optional)
   - Select "Public" visibility
   - Check the box to "Add a README file"
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Launch a Codespace

1. In your new repository, click on the green "Code" button
2. Select the "Codespaces" tab
3. Click on "Create codespace on main"
4. Wait for the codespace to initialize (this might take a minute or two)

### Step 3: Add an MIT License File

1. In the Codespace, click on the "Explorer" icon in the left sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+E)
2. Click on the "New File" icon and name the file "LICENSE"
3. Copy and paste the following MIT License text into the file:

```
MIT License

```

4. Save the file by pressing Ctrl+S or clicking File > Save

### Step 4: Commit and Push the License File

1. Click on the Source Control icon in the left sidebar (the icon looks like a branch, or press Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. You'll see the LICENSE file listed as a change
3. Hover over the LICENSE file and click the "+" icon to stage the change
4. Enter a commit message like "Add MIT License" in the text field at the top
5. Click the checkmark icon (âœ“) to commit the changes
6. Click on the Synch changes button
7. Click on ok and push the changes

### Step 5: Run the Required Command

1. In the Codespace, open the terminal (press Ctrl + `)
2. In the terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
   ```
   echo $GITHUB_REPOSITORY $GITHUB_TOKEN
   ```
3. Copy the entire output that appears in the terminal

### Step 6: Submit the Output

Paste the exact output from the echo command as your answer to the assignment question.

## IMPORTANT: Keep Your Codespace Active

**DO NOT close your Codespace until after you have submitted the entire Graded Assignment!**

If you close the Codespace before completing the submission process, you will lose access to the environment variables and potentially have to start over.

## Troubleshooting

- If your Codespace fails to launch, try refreshing the page and creating it again
- If the environment variables don't appear when running the echo command, ensure you're in the correct terminal session within the Codespace
- If you accidentally close the Codespace, you can try to reopen it from the Code > Codespaces menu in your repository, but the token might have changed
