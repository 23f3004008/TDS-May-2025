# Creating a FastAPI Server for Student Data

This guide will walk you through setting up a FastAPI server that serves student data from a CSV file, with filtering capability by class.

## Project Overview

You'll build a FastAPI application that:
- Reads student data from a CSV file
- Serves the data as JSON through an API endpoint
- Allows filtering students by class using query parameters
- Includes CORS support for cross-origin requests

## Step 1: Set Up Project Structure

Create the following project structure:

```
student-api/
│
├── q-fastapi.csv     # The CSV file with student data
├── main.py           # The FastAPI application
└── requirements.txt  # Project dependencies
```

## Step 2: Download the CSV File

1. Download the CSV file from the assignment
2. Rename it to `q-fastapi.csv` if necessary
3. Place it in your project directory

## Step 3: Create the Requirements File

Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
pandas
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 5: Create the FastAPI Application

Create a file named `main.py` with the following content:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import pandas as pd
from typing import List, Optional

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Enable CORS
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET"],  # Only allow GET requests
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("q-fastapi.csv")

# Convert DataFrame to the expected format
def get_students_data(class_filters=None):
    # If class filters are provided, filter the dataframe
    if class_filters:
        filtered_df = df[df['class'].isin(class_filters)]
    else:
        filtered_df = df
    
    # Convert to list of dictionaries
    students = []
    for _, row in filtered_df.iterrows():
        students.append({
            "studentId": int(row["studentId"]),
            "class": row["class"]
        })
    
    return students

@app.get("/api")
async def get_students(class_param: Optional[List[str]] = Query(None, alias="class")):
    """
    Get student data.
    Optional query parameter 'class' to filter by class (can be used multiple times).
    Example: /api?class=1A&class=1B
    """
    students = get_students_data(class_param)
    return {"students": students}

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Student API is running. Use /api endpoint to get student data."}

# Run the application directly if executed as a script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, reload=True)
```

## Step 6: Run the FastAPI Server

Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will start, and you'll see output similar to:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
INFO:     Started reloader process [28720]
INFO:     Started server process [28722]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
```

## Step 7: Access the API

Your API is now available at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

Try these example URLs:
- Get all students: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
- Get students in class 1A: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A
- Get students in classes 1A and 1B: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api?class=1A&class=1B

## Step 8
Enter the url in the answer
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

## IMPORTANT: Keep the Server Running

**DO NOT stop the FastAPI server until after you have submitted the entire Graded Assignment!**

If you need to restart your computer or close your terminal, simply run the command again:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you see a "No module found" error, make sure you've installed all dependencies with pip
- If you get a file not found error, check that `q-fastapi.csv` is in the same directory as `main.py`
- If the server won't start because the port is in use, you can specify a different port: `uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001`
- If you can't access the API, make sure the server is running and check your firewall settings
